 *   the calling process received pid as a return value from a successful
 *   call to exec.
 *

 *   spawns child process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is
 *   dead. A call to wait(C) by process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned
 *   processes are not assigned to a new parent if their parent process
 *   exits before they do.
 *
 * * The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is,
 *   a process may wait for any given child at most once.
 *
 * Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any
 * order, and may even exit without having waited for some or all of
 * their children. Your design should consider all the ways in which
 * waits can occur. All of a process's resources, including its struct
 * thread, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not,
 * and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
 *
 * You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial
 * process exits. The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling
 * process_wait() (in userprog/process.c) from main() (in threads/init.c).
