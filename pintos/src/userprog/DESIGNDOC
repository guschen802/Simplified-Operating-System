   New structure in process.c for passing argument:
   struct executable
     {
       char *command_line;            /* Pointer to command line in kernel page. */
       int argc;                      /* Argument count of command_line. */
       char** argv;                   /* fisrt argument pointer. */
       uint8_t *kpage;                /* Pointer to start of the kernel page. */
       size_t available;              /* Available size of memory in kernel page. */
       struct process_status *status; /* Process waiting status. */
       struct semaphore load_done;    /* Load done semaphore, 0-loading, 1-load_done. */
       bool success;                  /* Load success flag. */
     };

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

   1) Aquire a kernel page from pool.
   2) Make a copy of command by pushing command line on the aquired page. 
   3) Passing the struct executable containing the copied command and pointer 
      to kernel page all the way to setup_stack ().
   4) Use strtok_r() to parse the command line in setup_stack (), 
      push the pointer(translated to user vaddress) to parsed argument 
      onto kernel page.
   5) Reverse the pushed pointer to arguments.
   6) Push the pointer to argument pointer, arguments count and return address.

   The entirely command line is pushed onto stack directely, from the stack view, 
   it is in reverse order, since we use the pointer to get the actual data, we 
   only need to make sure the pointer is in right-order from stack view and 
   which is done in STEP.5.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

   Since Pintos support multiple process(kernel thread), using strtok() is 
   thread unsafe, since strtok() use a static buffer while strtok_r() need
   to pass a pointer to buffer provided by user.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

   First, it would be safer for the shell to deal with the separation. For 
   example the shell can check if the user type a right command, this will 
   make sure that the user will pass a right and safe command to the kernel. 

   In pintos, if the user type an unsafe command by mistake, it would cause 
   some serious problem when kernel parse the unsafe command.

   Second, it will be convenient for the user if the separation is done by 
   the shell. For example, with the help of PATH variable, we don't have to type 
   the full path for an executable file. In pintos, we have to type the full path 
   every time we need to access the executable file. Also the kernel need to look
   for a file with full path, it would be an expensive operation for the kernel.

            SYSTEM CALLS
            ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

   Added member to struct thread in thread.h:
   struct thread
     {
       /* Owned by process.c*/
       struct list children;                  /* List of its child process. */
       struct process_status* process_status; /* Pointer to current process running status. */

       /* Owned by syscall.c. */
       int next_fd;                           /* Next file descripte]or for opened file. */ 
       struct list opend_files;               /* List of files opened by this process. */
     };
     
   struct process_status
     {
       int tid;               /* Process tid. */
       struct list_elem elem; /* List element. */
       struct semaphore exit; /* Semaphore for exit status, 0-running, 1-exit*/
       int exit_code;         /* Exit status flag. */
     };

   New structure added in syscall.c:
   struct opened_file
     {
       struct list_elem elem; /* List element. */
       int fd;                /* File descriptor. */
       struct File file;      /* Associated file. */
     };

   Add new member to struct executable (describe in section A) in process.c:
   struct executable
     {
       struct semaphore load_done;  /* Load done semaphore, 0-loading, 1-load_done. */
       bool success;                /* Load success flag. */
     };

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

   We use a new structure created in syscall.c to associate the file descriptor
   with the opeded file. The file descriptors are unique within a single process,
   and the next file descriptor for new opened file is maintains by next_fd in
   struct thread.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

   First we check if the file descriptor is within the range of 2 to 127
   and if it's STDIN_FILENO for read() or STDOUT_FILENO for write(). And
   we call input_getc() to read from standard input and putbuf() to write
   to standard output. Then we valid the memory address user required. 
   First we would make sure that the virtual address user provided is blow 
   PHYS_BASE. Secondly, we would check that if the acquired page is already
   mapped. Only when these two conditions hold would the program be granted
   access to the data. If there are any unforeseen events happened afterwards,
   the page fault handler would take over. Last but not least, we access
   the list of open files located in thread structure to find the file 
   structure according to file descriptor to process file I/O request. The
   file structure tells us to use whether file_read_at() or file_write_at().

   The approach we implemented requires 0 inspections of page table. We 
   first check if the address is within PHYS_BASE, and if it's valid we
   let it get through until a page fault happened. Then we would handle 
   the page fault with page fault handler accordingly. In this way,
   inspection of page table would be 0 no matter how much data is requested.

   Since we do not inspect page table, there is no room for improvement. But
   the speed of memory accessing is still improvable if we can take advantage
   of hardware speed-up functions.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.
   
   Since we decide to use the tid_t as pid_t directly, when user call 
   sys_wait(pid), the kernel call process_wait(tid).
   In process_wait(), search the tid in process's children list, and
   use sema_down(exit) to wait for the child exit. After exit, the parent
   can get the exit_code.
   
   Sample steps of wait():
   1) Child process start, initilize semaphore exit to 0 indicating running, 
      and added to the parents children list.
   2) Parent process call wait(child_pid).
   3) wait() search the pid in its children list, when found, call sema_down(exit)
      to wait for the child process.
   4) Child process terminate, call sema_up(exit) to indicate tremination.
   5) Parent process waked up and check the exit_code flag.

   We converge the handling of bad pointer value to page fault handler. We
   actually do not prevent page fault from happening except for the access
   out of PHYS_BASE. When a invalid memory access invoked by system call is
   detected by system, it would send it over to page fault handler and the 
   handler would then set eax to 0xffffffff (return -1) and copies its former 
   value into eip. Then the system call responsible would detect that a page
   fault happened and release locks and free memory hold by process and
   terminate the process.

   For example, when a page fault happened in read(), the page fault handler
   would return -1 to the system call, and read() would detect the return value
   and call thread_exit() and process_exit() afterwards. The termination 
   functions would make sure that all the resources hold by the process would
   be freed or released before termination.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

   Since the new process is loaded asynchronously in a newly created kernel
   thread, the caller need to wait until the loading finished to get the
   success/failure status. So we use a semepore load_done initialize to 0
   indicating loading, and the caller need to wait until load_done is up to 1.
   After caller is unblock by the semaphore, it check the success flag in
   struct executable to get the load success/failure status.

   Execut program steps:
   1) Caller execute new program.
   2) Initialize semaphore load_done to 0.
   3) Load program asynchronously in new kernel thread.
   4) Caller call sema_down(load_done) to wait for loading complete.
   5) Loading complete, set flag success to true/false indicating the 
      load status.
   6) Loading thread call sema_up(load_done) to notify the caller.
   7) Caller wake up, then get load status from flag success.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

   We use a new allocated strucure process_status to monitor the child
   process exit status, and it is seperate from the thread's resourse, 
   even the child process is terminate and release the resource, the 
   process_status will not release until its parent process terminate.
   So the parent process can always get the exit status of its children 
   whatever they are alive or not.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

   We handle memory access failures in page fault handler as depicted in B4.
   It is faster than regular method since it don't need to inspect page 
   table also it take advantage of the processor's MMU. It's harder to
   implement but more generic and intrinsic. Because we don't check the
   virtual memory address thoroughly, there would be more page fault. This
   is a possible downside of our implementation.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

   We use a list to keep track of the opened file of the process.
   Advantages:    No need to worried about the number of opened file, the
                  list can expand arbitrarily.
   Disadvantages: When using file discriptor to access file, it will take
                  linear time to search for the associated file. 

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We will not change this for the design now.
